\begin{abstract}
This research project seeks to detail a comprehensive framework for teaching quantum computing algorithms to
graduate and postgraduate cryptography students.
I will focus on the use of Software Development Kits (SDKs) from leading quantum hardware and software companies
that are deliver world class quantum systems, emulators and quantum simulators via cloud environments.
The study seeks to identify the essential learning outcomes required for new researchers to become proficient
in constructing quantum circuits of increasing complexity.

We will perform a survey of available quantum computing platforms, evaluating them for their usability, scalability
and suitability for cryptographic applications.  We will look to implement key quantum algorithms used in
cryptanalysis (Shor, Grover, Quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPE), Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization
(Ising-QUBO), etc.), as well as introducing the supporting quantum principles and
mathematical models that underpin these algorithms (Hidden-subgroup problems, combinatorics, optimizations, etc.).
Further, we will look to see examples of how researchers are applying quantum techniques to attempt to solve the
Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and to attack Substitutionâ€“Permutation Networks (SPN), which underpins AES symmetric
encryption.
Some approaches, such as Quantum Annealing and Coherent Ising Machines, are claiming to show evidence of quantum
advantage and are of great interest.

The expectation of this project is to offer a practical pathway for new entrants to the field of quantum computing
to gain the skills to compete in this rapidly evolving and exciting area of research.
