\section{Conclusion}

This project set out to demonstrate that an outcome-based syllabus,
using both cloud based quantum hardware and local quantum simulators,
can fast-track students of cryptography, data science and applied mathematics
from zero exposure to genuine quantum-computing competence. 

The project structured the curriculum around clearly defined learning outcomes, 
developing mathematical chops, and anchoring the material in the well-understood building blocks 
of Shor's algorithm.  
We demonstrated a coherent teaching pathway that is deliverable with today's SDKs and hardware access.

The pilot with a small cohort of students indicates that scaling the material into a 
full programme is both feasible and worthwhile. 
The next phase is to develop the material further to deliver a complete education programme.

%There is futher work required to develop the actual lesson materials from the syllabus, 
%and we believe that this a worthwhile and meaningful body of work to undertake.
