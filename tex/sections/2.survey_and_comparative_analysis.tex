This survey seeks to identify quantum computing industry leaders with technology road-maps that would align with students
and researchers having confidence that the technology will evolve and be a stable platform for research and development.

\textbf{\emph{Objective}}

To provide a comprehensive comparison of available quantum hardware, simulators, and emulators, and analyze their suitability for educational purposes. This section should also cover technical aspects like qubit types, gate mechanics, and practical limitations (e.g., thermal noise), helping students understand the real-world constraints of quantum systems.

\textbf{\emph{How to Achieve This}}

\emph{Comparative Analysis}: Review and compare various quantum computing systems (e.g., IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq, Rigetti Forest, D-Wave) and their SDKs. Focus on usability, scalability, community support, and the types of qubit systems (e.g., superconducting qubits, trapped ions).
      
\emph{Technical Details}: Discuss the mechanics of quantum gates (e.g., single-qubit and multi-qubit gates) and practical issues like decoherence and thermal noise. Explain how these factors impact quantum computation and the limitations they impose on algorithm performance.
    
\emph{Suitability for Education}: Evaluate each system’s practicality for teaching purposes. Discuss whether simulators or emulators are preferable for certain topics, and how they support students’ understanding before transitioning to physical hardware.

\textbf{\emph{Challenges}}

\emph{Technical Complexity}: Explaining concepts like thermal noise and gate fidelity can be challenging for readers new to quantum computing. Providing clear analogies and visuals may help convey these ideas effectively.
    
\emph{Keeping the Survey Current}: Quantum technology evolves quickly, so it may be difficult to ensure that the survey reflects the latest advancements. Rely on recent literature and technical resources, and acknowledge that some aspects may become outdated.

\subsection{Quantum Computing Systems}

As thermal energy can cause decoherence in many qubit technologies, increasing the noise in the probabilistic solution
results.
Because of this, manufacturers can use error correction by constructing logical qubits from several physical qubits,
increasing the accuracy of their systems.
IBM, for example in their Heron processor, used two qubit gates to achieve a 99.7\% fidelity for a total of 156
programmable qubits \cite{IBM:heronr2:2024}.

  D-Wave also announced plans for gate-based systems.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Quantum SDKs and Emulators}

Most major quantum hardware manufacturers have also developed their own software platforms for constructing quantum
circuits and integrating with their computing infrastructure.
These platforms will typically also have quantum emulators that allow development without the expense of actually
running on an actual quantum machine.

\subsection{Other Considerations for evaluation}

Back in \citeyear{Ft:Gourianov:2022} \citeauthor{Ft:Gourianov:2022}, in the Financial Times newspaper \cite{Ft:Gourianov:2022}
warned of the financial excesses of irrational exuberance due to over-optimism of the prospects of quantum computing.  

\emph{rewrite everything from this point forward}

\subsection{Classes of Quantum Algorithms}

Using \citeauthor{Arnault:2024} \citeyear{Arnault:2024} \cite{Arnault:2024} classification of mathematical classes
and application domains of quantum algorithms.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hidden-Subgroup Problems}: This class of problems involves finding a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ such
  that a function $f(x)$ is constant “on” each coset of $H$, meaning that, for all $g_1, g_2 \in G$, $f(g_1) = f(g_2)$
  if and only if $g_1H = g_2H$.
  Shor’s algorithm, which solves the problems of prime-numbers factorisation and of computing discrete logarithms,
  can be generalised as an HSP for finite Abelian groups.

\item \textbf{Linear Algebra}: Linear-algebra problems involve linear equations, linear transformations and their
  representations using matrices.
  For example, the Quantum Singular-Value Decomposition (QSVD) algorithm produces the singular-value decomposition of a matrix.

\item \textbf{Dynamical Systems}:  Dynamical systems are mathematical models used to describe the evolution of a
  system over time, typically governed by differential equations (e.g. an equation that is an ordinary differential
  equation with respect to time, with finite differences in space).
  Quantum algorithms that belong to this class seek to predict and analyse the system’s time evolution, e.g., by
  preparing an initial state, encoding information therein, evolving it, or evaluating key features of this evolution.
  For instance, the Quantum Lanczos algorithm computes the ground state of some Hamiltonian, which is a key feature of
  the evolution of the system described by the Hamiltonian.
  
\item \textbf{Stochastic Processes \& Statistics}:  A stochastic process is a mathematical object that describes the
  evolution of a random variable over time. Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organisation,
  analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
  An example of an algorithm that solves a stochastic-processes problem is the Gaussian-Boson-Sampling (GBS)
  Matrix-Point Process – which, in addition, is a sampling algorithm. An example of an algorithm that solves a
  statistics problem is the Quantum k-means algorithm.

\item \textbf{Optimisation}: “Optimisation” refers to the class of problems that deal with finding the best solution
  among a given set of candidates. The “best” solution is determined by minimizing or maximising some target function
  while satisfying a set of constraints.
  Optimisation includes numerical optimisation and combinatorial optimisation problems. An example is the
  Quantum Linear Regression algorithm, whose fundamental mathematical problem is linear regression using least-squares
  optimisation, which is convex optimisation (which is a subclass of numerical optimisation).

\item \textbf{Combinatorics}: Combinatorial problems involve finding, for a discrete finite set of objects that
  satisfy some given conditions, either a grouping, or an ordering, or an assignment. They can be divided into
  three basic types: enumeration problems, existence problems, and optimisation problems.
  An algorithm classified under “Combinatorics” in the classification table focuses on solving problems like
  graph-theoretical problems, search tasks, counting tasks, etc. For example, Grover’s search algorithm has been
  extended to Quantum Counting, and both can be classified as combinatorial.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{D-Wave}

The question of whether D-Wave annealers offer a true quantum advantage over classical computing is still under
debate within the scientific community
D-Wave's software development environment, Ocean, provides tools for hybrid algorithm development. Hybrid algorithms
combine classical computing with quantum annealing, allowing users to leverage the strengths of both approaches.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Optimisation}: D-Wave quantum annealers are specifically designed to solve optimisation problems by
  finding the global minimum energy state of a system. Many problems can be translated into quantum annealing problems
  using QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation) or Ising problem formulations. D-Wave's most efficient tools
  are its hybrid solvers, which use both classical computing and their annealer.
  
\item \textbf{Combinatorics}: Optimisation problems are a subset of combinatorial problems, so D-Wave annealers can be
  used to solve some problems in the Combinatorics class.
  D-Wave annealers can theoretically solve NP-complete problems.

\item \textbf{Machine Learning}: D-Wave's quantum annealers can be used for machine learning tasks because they are
  well-suited to finding the minimum energy of complex systems, which is equivalent to searching for a minimum level
  of errors in the adjustment of the weights of neurons in a neural network.
  D-Wave has tested a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model and a hybrid algorithm for image recognition using a
  variational circuit and a hybrid algorithm.
\end{itemize}
