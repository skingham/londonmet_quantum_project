This book introduces the reader to the next generation of cryptographic algorithms, the systems that resist quantum-computer attacks: in particular, post-quantum public-key encryption systems and post-quantum public-key signature systems. Leading experts have joined forces for the first time to explain the state of the art in quantum computing, hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography. Mathematical foundations and implementation issues are included. This book is an essential resource for students and researchers who want to contribute to the field of post-quantum cryptography.}

    abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be “signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in “electronic mail” and “electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored. },

abstract = {The looming threat of quantum attacks on the digital infrastructure protected by conventional cryptographic protocol has generated urgency in identifying and deploying countermeasures that can mitigate the threat. There is a need for stronger cryptographic schemes that combine the strengths of both classic and quantum technologies. Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) has emerged as a potential solution that can withstand the challenges posed by advances in quantum computing. Owing to the increasing importance of PQC, the present research is an attempt to assess the existing research done so far so that the existing gaps can be identified which can then strengthen the existing literature. The systematic literature review presented in this work has outlined six key categories of PQC, namely, lattice-based, code-based, hash-based, multivariate, isogeny-based, symmetric-key-based cryptosystems. The study concluded that the advances made in quantum computing will result in the development of quantum computers with superior computational power. Such highly efficient quantum computers will have the ability to break the currently available cryptography schemes most used in a variety of practical applications. With the advent of quantum computing, the computational capabilities of the potential cyber attackers would grow exponentially, which would render the traditional cyber security measures inadequate. This calls for techniques like PQC to be developed and strengthen.}
